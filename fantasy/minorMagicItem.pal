Mask of the Jester, which compels others to attack the wearer
Eye of Zin, a gem which turns the wearer's eyes jet black, grants darkvision--and making them blindingly sensitive to even small amounts of light--when pressed into the forehead
Metal Eye Mask, a mask which obscures one's normal vision, but allows one to see from above, like an orbital satellite's view
Pink Bead, a bead which--when smashed on the ground--immediately turns into a huge mountain of fluffy bubbles, similar in consistency to a mass of fused marshmallows
50' of animate rope with the personality of a loyal dog
